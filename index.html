            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                On the modern web, trackers and advertisers frequently construct and monetize users‚Äô detailed behavioral profiles without consent. 
                Despite various studies on web tracking mechanisms and advertisements, there has been no rigorous
                study focusing on websites targeted at children. To address
                this gap, we present a measurement of tracking and (targeted)
                advertising on websites directed at children.
                The findings reveal that approximately 90% of these websites employ trackers and 27% display targeted advertisements without 
                adequate parental consent. The study also exposes the presence of inappropriate ads, emphasizing a widespread non-compliance 
                with privacy regulations and the urgent need for more stringent protective measures for children online.

            <h3 style="color: #b82424;">üö´ Improper Ads on Children's Websites</h3>
            <p>
                In our study, we identified and measured four types of ads: weight loss ads, mental health ads, dating services ads, and ads containing clickbait racy content. 
                Figure 1 illustrates the ad content analysis pipeline. To detect ads with clickbait racy content, we utilized <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-safe-search">Google Cloud Vision API‚Äôs SafeSearch Detection</a>.
                Additionally, we used semantic similarity to identify the most relevant ad texts for the queries "weight loss," "mental health," and "dating." 
                Table 1 shows the number of improper ads identified in
                each crawl, amounting to 1,003 across 311 distinct websites.
                A notable finding is the higher prevalence of such ads on
                mobile devices compared to desktops in general.

            <p>In Figure 2, we provide additional examples of advertisements that are likely not suitable for children. Examples
                of these included an ad for a test called ‚ÄúAm I Gay Test‚Äù ‚ìì , for a sex toy ‚ìò and a sex toy shop ‚ìë featuring an
                image of ice cream that could be appealing to children, and
                ads featuring clickbait and sexually suggestive images. The
                ads were found on websites related to K-12 e-learning, kids
                games, coloring books and worksheets, among others.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #b82424;"> Targeted Ads on Children's Websites</h3>
            <p><b>Over 70% of ads with disclosures are targeted in
                nature.</b>  Our crawler captured a total of 40,281 ad disclosure
                pages, which we used to determine the advertiser‚Äôs identity
                and whether ad targeting is enabled or not. There are fewer
                disclosure pages than ads due to ads without disclosure links
                and failures in detecting or opening those links. In fact, we
                only consider ad disclosures from two ad providers: Google
                (97.8%) and Criteo (2.2%), since ad disclosure pages of
                other providers did not reveal the targeted status of the ad or the advertisers‚Äô identity. In Table 2, we show the the results of our analysis of ad disclosures.
                <br>
                Comparing the Tranco ranks of the 689 websites that contain
                    at least one targeted ad to 59 websites that only contain
                    non-targeted ads, we find a tendency for popular websites
                    to disable ad targeting (Figure 2). Sites with targeted ads
                    had a median rank of ‚àº 340K, while those with only nontargeted ads had a median rank of ‚àº 128K.

            <p>
                We also conducted a comprehensive analysis of tracking and fingerprinting on children's websites. 
                Table 3 shows the average number of third-party and tracker domains, and the prevalence of tracking and fingerprinting on
child-directed websites from five vantage points. 
<br>
We also conducted an additional analysis to compare how the
number of third parties and trackers change between websites with and without ads. Figure 4 shows that websites with
ads tend to have substantially more third-party and tracker
domains.

            These websites, likely receiving significant traffic as they are among the top one million, all displayed targeted ads. 
            The numbers in the table reflect average trackers, requests, and cookies across web pages.
