            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                On the modern web, trackers and advertisers frequently construct and monetize users‚Äô detailed behavioral profiles without consent. 
                Despite various studies on web tracking mechanisms and advertisements, there has been no rigorous
                study focusing on websites targeted at children. To address
                this gap, we present a measurement of tracking and (targeted)
                advertising on websites directed at children.
                The findings reveal that approximately 90% of these websites employ trackers and 27% display targeted advertisements without 
                adequate parental consent. The study also exposes the presence of inappropriate ads, emphasizing a widespread non-compliance 
                with privacy regulations and the urgent need for more stringent protective measures for children online.

            <h3 style="color: #b82424;">üö´ Improper Ads on Children's Websites</h3>
            <p>
                In our study, we identified and measured four types of ads: weight loss ads, mental health ads, dating services ads, and ads containing clickbait racy content. 
                Figure 1 illustrates the ad content analysis pipeline. To detect ads with clickbait racy content, we utilized <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/detecting-safe-search">Google Cloud Vision API‚Äôs SafeSearch Detection</a>.
                Additionally, we used semantic similarity to identify the most relevant ad texts for the queries "weight loss," "mental health," and "dating." 
                Table 1 shows the number of improper ads identified in
                each crawl, amounting to 1,003 across 311 distinct websites.
                A notable finding is the higher prevalence of such ads on
                mobile devices compared to desktops in general.

            <p>In Figure 2, we provide additional examples of advertisements that are likely not suitable for children. Examples
                of these included an ad for a test called ‚ÄúAm I Gay Test‚Äù ‚ìì , for a sex toy ‚ìò and a sex toy shop ‚ìë featuring an
                image of ice cream that could be appealing to children, and
                ads featuring clickbait and sexually suggestive images. The
                ads were found on websites related to K-12 e-learning, kids
                games, coloring books and worksheets, among others.</p>
