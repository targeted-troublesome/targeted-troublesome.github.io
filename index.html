                On the modern web, trackers and advertisers frequently construct and monetize users’ detailed behavioral profiles without consent. 
                Despite various studies on web tracking mechanisms and advertisements, there has been no rigorous
                study focusing on websites targeted at children. To address
                this gap, we present a measurement of tracking and (targeted)
                advertising on websites directed at children. 
                The findings reveal that approximately 90% of these websites employ trackers and 27% display targeted advertisements without 
                adequate parental consent. The study also exposes the presence of inappropriate ads, emphasizing a widespread non-compliance 
                with privacy regulations and the urgent need for more stringent protective measures for children online.
